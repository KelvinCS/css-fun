# Hello!

Oh, you found me! But, wait, what were you waiting for?

This is not an ordinary place: this is an experimental, full of discoveries (and failures), place.
That repo is meant to be a memo, a memo of what I should learn: css. Yeah, css is so awesome! 
Then, be carefull, play around and... yeah, do what you have to do.
